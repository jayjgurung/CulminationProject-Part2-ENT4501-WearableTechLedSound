Project Title: WearableTech-AV-JayG
Sprint #: 1
Date Range: Sept 2 - Sept 16 (Week 2 & Week 3)
Prepared by: Jay J Gurung

Purpose: 
The purpose of this sprint is to asses and identify, plan refine my project ideas at where it stands and overcome some challenges facing the projects in small steps.

The goal of the first half of my Culmination Project was to assemble a rough prototype that could manage to do some basic physical computing processes like reading and reacting to the input it is given. Although it did do some basic things I ran into some issues with the type of microphone sensor i had, which did not behave as planned.
    Although I am happy with what I got done so far, I would need to do some extensive research so I can find the right microphone that can read and react to it as it should.
THe Microphone I aquired had sensitive potentiometer that was not consistant with the reading, on top of that it could only read the amplitude. While my project required a mic that could read amplitude and frequency of the live audio, my attempt to get just use the amplitude reading did not fully work as planned because of unreliable hardware component in the mic unit.
    The feedback i received can be found in documents posted in the following  directory: "Docs/PanelFeedback-Fall2024" 
Images, documentation and video demo of my project's latest progress can be found in "Assets" folder.

My plan for the next 2 weeks is to Research on microphone sensors, and aquire the right components and test it in the Arduion IDE. In addition, I will be modifying the code in "/Prototype_Code" folder to cater to the needs of the new mic component.
    My target before Week4 is to be able to communicate LED lights with with the mic using IDE.

Checklist:
    1. Research microphone for Arduino 
    2. Order parts
    3. Communicate and program the sensor and output.
    4. Refine
