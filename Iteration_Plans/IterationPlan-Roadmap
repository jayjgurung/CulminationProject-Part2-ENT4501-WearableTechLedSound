Iteration Plan (Roadmap)

⸻

Weeks 1–3 (Sprint 1) – Speculate + Research
	•	Setup GitHub repository & documentation framework.
	•	Researched mic sensor options (MAX9814 vs INMP441).
	•	Explored FFT libraries for ESP32.
	•	Ordered core components (ESP32-WROVER, WS2812B LEDs, mic, battery).

⸻

Weeks 4–7 (Sprint 2) – Design + Build Foundation
	•	Integrated rechargeable lithium-ion battery + USB-C charger board.
	•	Added power switch for safe portable operation.
	•	Expanded FFT mapping from 3 → 5 bands.
	•	Installed WS2812B LED chain with band-to-LED mapping.
	•	Verified FFT + LED response using test audio.
	•	Installed and calibrated I2S MEMS microphone (INMP441).
	•	Added potentiometer (GPIO34) for real-time sensitivity adjustment.
    •	Debugged I2S driver conflicts (migrated to new i2s_std.h).


⸻

Weeks 8–9 (Sprint 3) – Publish & Peer Feedback
	•	Prepared for Jury #1 presentation (project overview, slides, repo updates).
	•	Shared early prototype (LEDs responding to FFT magnitudes).
	•	Collected faculty and peer feedback.

⸻

Weeks 10–13 (Sprint 4) – Develop & Assess (In Progress)
	•	Begin IR remote integration (mode toggle, brightness control).
	•	Improv LED thresholds for high frequencies.
	•	Add Serial monitor debugging for per-band amplitudes.

⸻

Weeks 14–15 (Sprint 5) – Finalize & Present
	•	Complete IR remote mapping (modes: audio-reactive, ambient presets, demo cycle).
	•	Implement smoothing filters to reduce LED flicker.
	•	Optimize FFT bin grouping for balanced bass/treble response.
	•	Document battery run-time & power consumption.
	•	Casing / Body Work:
	•	Design and prototype a simpler housing (instead of jacket integration).
	•	Explore lightweight enclosure options to contain ESP32, mic, LEDs, and power system.
	•	Ensure accessibility for USB-C charging and power switch.
	•	Prepare final Jury presentation (slides + live demo).
	•	Freeze GitHub repo with final code, diagrams, Agile reports.
